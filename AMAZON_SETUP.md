# Get Your Amazon Associate Tag ID

## Quick Steps:

1. Go to: https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/home/account/tag/manage

2. Look for "Tracking ID" or "Store ID" - it looks like:
   - `yourname-20`
   - `legendgamer-20`
   - Something ending in `-20`

3. Copy that ID and paste it below:

Once you give me your tracking ID, I'll integrate it so:
- Real Amazon products will appear in your store
- When customers buy, you earn 3-10% commission
- Amazon deposits money directly to your PNC bank account

## How You'll Make Money:

**Option A: Affiliate Commission Only (Easiest)**
Customer → Your Store → Clicks product → Goes to Amazon → Buys → You earn 3-10%

**Option B: Full Dropshipping (Higher Profit)**
Customer → Your Store → Buys for $100 (via Stripe) → You order from Amazon for $50 → You keep $50 profit + Amazon ships it

Which model do you prefer? I can set up either!
