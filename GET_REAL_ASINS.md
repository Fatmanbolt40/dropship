# GET REAL WORKING AMAZON ASINs

## THE PROBLEM
All ASINs I tried are giving 404 errors. I can't programmatically verify them because Amazon blocks bots.

## THE SOLUTION - YOU NEED TO DO THIS:

### Step 1: Find 10-15 Products on Amazon
1. Go to https://www.amazon.com
2. Browse for products you want to sell (electronics, home goods, etc.)
3. Find products that:
   - Cost between $10-$50
   - Have good reviews (4+ stars)
   - Are in stock
   - Are popular items

### Step 2: Copy the ASIN
For each product:
1. Click on the product
2. Look at the URL in your browser
3. Find the ASIN (it's the code after `/dp/`)

**Example:**
```
URL: https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Pro-2nd-Generation/dp/B0CHWRXH8B
ASIN: B0CHWRXH8B
```

### Step 3: Paste Them Here in This Format

```
ASIN: B0CHWRXH8B | Product Name: Apple AirPods Pro | Price: 249.99
ASIN: YOURCODE2 | Product Name: Product 2 Name | Price: 29.99
ASIN: YOURCODE3 | Product Name: Product 3 Name | Price: 19.99
```

### Step 4: Tell Me When Ready
Once you have 10-15 ASINs, paste them in the chat and say "ready to add products"

## QUICK METHOD - Copy from Best Sellers

1. Go to: https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers/zgbs
2. Browse categories (Electronics, Home & Kitchen, etc.)
3. Click on products that look good
4. Copy ASIN from URL
5. Paste in format above

---

## IMPORTANT
- Use YOUR Amazon.com account to browse
- Make sure products show "In Stock"
- Don't use products with regional restrictions
- Your affiliate tag (legend0ee-20) will work with any valid ASIN

---

Once you provide the ASINs, I'll:
1. Update verified_amazon_products.py
2. Clear all old campaigns
3. Generate new products with YOUR working ASINs
4. Your store will have REAL links that work!
