## TROUBLESHOOTING:

**"Could not find ASIN in URL"**
- Make sure you copied the full Amazon URL
- URL must contain `/dp/ASINCODE` or `/gp/product/ASINCODE`

**"Error: Failed to add product"**
- Check server is running (should see products on main page)
- Try copying the URL again
- Make sure ASIN is 10 characters (letters and numbers)

**Product added but name is generic**
- This is normal if Amazon blocks the page scraper
- You can manually edit the name later (feature coming soon)
- Product will still work perfectly with transactions
