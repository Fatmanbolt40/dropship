## 📋 PRESENTATION SCRIPT (30 minutes)

### Opening (2 min)

**YOU SAY:**
"Thanks for meeting with me. I want to show you something that's going to completely transform your drop shipping business. This is an AI platform that automates 90% of the work that's currently eating up your time."

**ACTION:** Share your screen, terminal ready

---

### Part 1: The Problem (3 min)

**YOU SAY:**
"Right now, when you want to find a winning product, what do you do? You probably spend hours researching trends, checking AliExpress, analyzing competitors, writing product descriptions, creating ads... Am I right?"

**[Let them respond]**

"And after all that work, maybe 1 out of 10 products actually works. That's a 90% failure rate and hundreds of hours wasted."

---

### Part 2: The Solution - Live Demo (15 min)

**YOU SAY:**
"Let me show you how this platform solves that. I'm going to analyze a product in real-time."

**ACTION:** Run the demo
```bash
python demo.py
```

**AS IT RUNS, YOU SAY:**

#### 1. Product Research (when it shows trend analysis):
"See this? The AI just analyzed this product across Google Trends, TikTok, Instagram, Amazon, eBay, and Reddit. In 5 seconds. It's giving us a trend score of [READ THE NUMBER], which means [READ RECOMMENDATION].

Look at the target audience - it's telling us exactly who to market to. The profit margin calculation shows we can make [READ MARGIN] on each sale. This analysis would normally take you 3-4 hours. The AI did it instantly."

#### 2. Content Generation (when it shows product description):
"Now watch this - it just wrote a complete product description. This isn't template garbage, this is SEO-optimized, conversion-focused copy that would cost you $50-100 from a copywriter. And it did it in 2 seconds.

[READ PART OF THE DESCRIPTION]

See how it includes emotional triggers, benefits, and a call-to-action? That's professional-level copywriting."

#### 3. Ad Copy (when it shows ad headlines):
"Here's where it gets really powerful. It just generated 5 different ad headlines, multiple body copy variations, and identified 3 target audiences with their demographics and platform preferences.

[READ A FEW HEADLINES]

Most people spend $500-1000 testing different ad variations. This gives you a head start with proven formulas."

#### 4. Video Scripts (when it shows TikTok script):
"And check this out - it created a complete 30-second TikTok script with timing, voiceover, visuals, and text overlays. This is a $300 service on Fiverr, and you can generate unlimited variations."

### Part 5: Pricing & Close (2 min)

**YOU SAY:**
"Here's what it costs:

**Option 1:** $997/month all-inclusive - unlimited products, all features

**Option 2:** $2,997 setup + $497/month - includes custom integration

**Option 3:** 5% revenue share - only pay when you make money

For you, I'm offering a limited launch special: 50% off the first 3 months plus free setup (normally $2,997). That's a $6,500 value.

You also get:

The only question is: can you afford NOT to have this? Every day without it is money left on the table."

### Handling Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
→ "Let's do the math. If this helps you find just ONE extra winning product per month, that's $5,000-$10,000 in profit. The platform pays for itself 10x over."

**"I need to think about it"**  
→ "I understand. But we only have 3 launch spots left at this price. After that, it goes to full price. Can we at least lock in your spot today?"

**"Can I try it first?"**
→ "Absolutely. I can give you a 14-day trial, but the 50% discount is only available if you commit today. Let's start the trial and if you love it (which you will), we'll activate the discount."

---

### Closing

**YOU SAY:**
"So here's what happens next:
1. We sign the agreement today
2. I'll have you set up within 48 hours  
3. We do a 2-hour onboarding call
4. You start finding winning products this week

Sound good? Let's get you started."
